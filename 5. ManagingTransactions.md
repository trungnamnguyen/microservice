ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions greatly simplify the job of the developer by providing the illusion that each transaction has exclusive access to the data

In a microservice architecture, transactions that are within a single service can still use ACID transactions. The challenge, however, lies in implementing transactions for operations that update data owned by multiple services.

Instead of an ACID transactions, an operation that spans services must use what’s known as a saga, a message-driven sequence of local transactions, to maintain data consistency

# 1. Transaction management in a microservice architecture

Transaction management is straightforward in a monolithic application that accesses a single database. 

Transaction management is more challenging in a complex monolithic application that uses multiple databases and message brokers.
And in a microservice architecture, transactions span multiple services, each of which has its own database

# 1. Using the Saga pattern to maintain data consistency

Sagas are mechanisms to maintain data consistency in a microservice architecture without having to use distributed transactions.

A saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates data within a single service using the familiar ACID transaction frameworks.

Sagas differ from ACID transactions in a couple of important ways. They lack the isolation property of ACID transactions. Also, because each local transaction commits its changes, a saga must be rolled back using compensating transactions.

**AN EXAMPLE SAGA: THE CREATE ORDER SAGA**

![sagaexample.JPG](assets/sagaexample.JPG?t=1700581056703)

This saga consists of the following local transactions:

- Order Service—Create an Order in an APPROVAL_PENDING state.
- Consumer Service—Verify that the consumer can place an order.
- Kitchen Service—Validate order details and create a Ticket in the CREATE_PENDING.
- Accounting Service—Authorize consumer’s credit card.
- Kitchen Service—Change the state of the Ticket to AWAITING_ACCEPTANCE.
- Order Service—Change the state of the Order to APPROVED.

**SAGAS USE COMPENSATING TRANSACTIONS TO ROLL BACK CHANGES**

In this scenario, the saga executes the following local transactions:

- Order Service—Create an Order in an APPROVAL_PENDING state.
- Consumer Service—Verify that the consumer can place an order.
- Kitchen Service—Validate order details and create a Ticket in the CREATE_PENDING state.
- Accounting Service—Authorize consumer’s credit card, which fails.
- Kitchen Service—Change the state of the Ticket to CREATE_REJECTED.
- Order Service—Change the state of the Order to REJECTED.

# 2. Coordinating sagas

There are a couple of different ways to structure a saga’s coordination logic:

- **Choreography**—Distribute the decision making and sequencing among the saga participants. They primarily communicate by exchanging events.
- **Orchestration**—Centralize a saga’s coordination logic in a saga orchestrator class. A saga orchestrator sends command messages to saga participants telling them which operations to perform.

## 2.1. Choreography-based sagas

When using choreography, there’s no central coordinator telling the saga participants what to do.Instead, the saga participants subscribe to each other’s events and respond accordingly

**IMPLEMENTING THE CREATE ORDER SAGA USING CHOREOGRAPHY**

![choreograpghy.JPG](assets/choreograpghy.JPG?t=1700581056703)

The happy path through this saga is as follows:

- Order Service creates an Order in the APPROVAL_PENDING state and publishes an OrderCreated event.
- Consumer Service consumes the OrderCreated event, verifies that the consumer can place the order, and publishes a ConsumerVerified event.
- Kitchen Service consumes the OrderCreated event, validates the Order, creates a Ticket in a CREATE_PENDING state, and publishes the TicketCreated event.
- Accounting Service consumes the OrderCreated event and creates a CreditCardAuthorization in a PENDING state.
- Accounting Service consumes the TicketCreated and ConsumerVerified events, charges the consumer’s credit card, and publishes the CreditCardAuthorized event.
- Kitchen Service consumes the CreditCardAuthorized event and changes the state of the Ticket to AWAITING_ACCEPTANCE.
- Order Service receives the CreditCardAuthorized events, changes the state of the Order to APPROVED, and publishes an OrderApproved event.

For example, the authorization of the consumer’s credit card might fail. The saga must execute the compensating transactions to undo what’s already been done. Figure 4.5 shows the flow of events when the AccountingService can’t authorize the consumer’s credit card.
![choreograpghyfail.JPG](assets/choreograpghyfail.JPG?t=1700581056703)

The sequence of events is as follows:

- Order Service creates an Order in the APPROVAL_PENDING state and publishes an OrderCreated event.
- Consumer Service consumes the OrderCreated event, verifies that the consumer can place the order, and publishes a ConsumerVerified event.
- Kitchen Service consumes the OrderCreated event, validates the Order, creates a Ticket in a CREATE_PENDING state, and publishes the TicketCreated event.
- Accounting Service consumes the OrderCreated event and creates a CreditCardAuthorization in a PENDING state.
- Accounting Service consumes the TicketCreated and ConsumerVerified events, charges the consumer’s credit card, and publishes a Credit Card Authorization Failed event.
- Kitchen Service consumes the Credit Card Authorization Failed event and changes the state of the Ticket to REJECTED.
- Order Service consumes the Credit Card Authorization Failed event and changes the state of the Order to REJECTED.

**RELIABLE EVENT-BASED COMMUNICATION**

The first issue is ensuring that a saga participant updates its database and publishes an event as part of a database transaction
=> Consequently, to communicate reliably, the saga participants must use transactional messaging

The second issue you need to consider is ensuring that a saga participant must be able to map each event that it receives to its own data. 
=> The solution is for a saga participant to publish events containing a correlation id, which is data that enables other participants to perform the mapping.

**BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF CHOREOGRAPHY-BASED SAGAS**

Choreography-based sagas have several benefits:

- **Simplicity**—Services publish events when they create, update, or delete business objects.
- **Loose coupling**—The participants subscribe to events and don’t have direct knowledge of each other.
And there are some drawbacks:

- **More difficult to understand**—Unlike with orchestration, there isn’t a single place in the code that defines the saga. Instead, choreography distributes the implementation of the saga among the services. Consequently, it’s sometimes difficult for a developer to understand how a given saga works.
- **Cyclic dependencies between the services**—The saga participants subscribe to each other’s events, which often creates cyclic dependencies. 
- **Risk of tight coupling**—Each saga participant needs to subscribe to all events that affect them. For example, Accounting Service must subscribe to all events that cause the consumer’s credit card to be charged or refunded. As a result, there’s a risk that it would need to be updated in lockstep with the order lifecycle implemented by Order Service.

## 2.2. Orchestration-based sagas

Orchestration is another way to implement sagas. When using orchestration, you define an orchestrator class whose sole responsibility is to tell the saga participants what to do. The saga orchestrator communicates with the participants using command/async reply-style interaction. To execute a saga step, it sends a command message to a participant telling it what operation to perform. After the saga participant has performed the operation, it sends a reply message to the orchestrator. The orchestrator then processes the message and determines which saga step to perform next.

**IMPLEMENTING THE CREATE ORDER SAGA USING ORCHESTRATION**

![orchestration.JPG](assets/orchestration.JPG?t=1700581056703)

Order Service first creates an Order and a Create Order Saga orchestrator. After that, the flow for the happy path is as follows:

- The saga orchestrator sends a Verify Consumer command to Consumer Service.
- Consumer Service replies with a Consumer Verified message.
- The saga orchestrator sends a Create Ticket command to Kitchen Service.
- Kitchen Service replies with a Ticket Created message.
- The saga orchestrator sends an Authorize Card message to Accounting Service.
- Accounting Service replies with a Card Authorized message.
- The saga orchestrator sends an Approve Ticket command to Kitchen Service.
- The saga orchestrator sends an Approve Order command to Order Service.

**MODELING SAGA ORCHESTRATORS AS STATE MACHINES**

This state machine consists of numerous states, including the following:

- **Verifying Consumer**—The initial state. When in this state, the saga is waiting for the Consumer Service to verify that the consumer can place the order.
- **Creating Ticket**—The saga is waiting for a reply to the Create Ticket command.
- **Authorizing Card**—Waiting for Accounting Service to authorize the consumer’s credit card.
- **Order Approved**—A final state indicating that the saga completed successfully.
- **Order Rejected**—A final state indicating that the Order was rejected by one of the participants.

**SAGA ORCHESTRATION AND TRANSACTIONAL MESSAGING**

BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF ORCHESTRATION-BASED SAGAS

Orchestration-based sagas have several benefits:

- Simpler dependencies—One benefit of orchestration is that it doesn’t introduce cyclic dependencies. The saga orchestrator invokes the saga participants, but the participants don’t invoke the orchestrator. As a result, the orchestrator depends on the participants but not vice versa, and so there are no cyclic dependencies.
- Less coupling—Each service implements an API that is invoked by the orchestrator, so it does not need to know about the events published by the saga participants.
- Improves separation of concerns and simplifies the business logic—The saga coordination logic is localized in the saga orchestrator. The domain objects are simpler and have no knowledge of the sagas that they participate in. For example, when using orchestration, the Order class has no knowledge of any of the sagas, so it has a simpler state machine model. During the execution of the Create Order Saga, it transitions directly from the APPROVAL_PENDING state to the APPROVED state. The Order class doesn’t have any intermediate states corresponding to the steps of the saga. As a result, the business is much simpler.

Orchestration also has a drawback: the risk of centralizing too much business logic in the orchestrator.

**Orchestration also has a drawback**: the risk of centralizing too much business logic in the orchestrator. This results in a design where the smart orchestrator tells the dumb services what operations to do. Fortunately, you can avoid this problem by designing orchestrators that are solely responsible for sequencing and don’t contain any other business logic.

# 3. Handling the lack of isolation
The challenge with using sagas is that they lack the isolation property of ACID transactions. This behavior can cause two problems. First, other sagas can change the data accessed by the saga while it’s executing. And other sagas can read its data before the saga has completed its updates, and consequently can be exposed to inconsistent data.
This behavior can cause two problems. First, other sagas can change the data accessed by the saga while it’s executing. And other sagas can read its data before the saga has completed its updates, and consequently can be exposed to inconsistent data. You can, in fact, consider a saga to be ACD:

- Atomicity—The saga implementation ensures that all transactions are executed or all changes are undone.
- Consistency—Referential integrity within a service is handled by local databases. Referential integrity across services is handled by the services.
- Durability—Handled by local databases.


The lack of isolation can cause the following three anomalies:

- **Lost updates**—One saga overwrites without reading changes made by another saga.
- **Dirty reads**—A transaction or a saga reads the updates made by a saga that has not yet completed those updates.
- **Fuzzy/nonrepeatable reads**—Two different steps of a saga read the same data and get different results because another saga has made updates.
