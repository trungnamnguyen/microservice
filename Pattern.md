The Microservice architecture pattern language is a collection of patterns that help you architect an application using the microservice architecture. Figure 1.10 shows the high-level structure of the pattern language. The pattern language first helps you decide whether to use the microservice architecture. It describes the monolithic architecture and the microservice architecture, along with their benefits and drawbacks. Then, if the microservice architecture is a good fit for your application, the pattern language helps you use it effectively by solving various architecture and design issues.

**The patterns are also divided into three layers:**

1. **Infrastructure patterns**—These solve problems that are mostly infrastructure issues outside of development.
2. **Application infrastructure**—These are for infrastructure issues that also impact development.
3. **Application patterns**—These solve problems faced by developers.
