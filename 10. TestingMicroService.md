Testing is primarily an activity that happens after development

What’s more, most of their testing is done manually: 

- **Manual testing is extremely inefficient**—You should never ask a human to do what a machine can do better. Compared to machines, humans are slow and can’t work 24/7. You won’t be able to deliver software rapidly and safely if you rely on manual testing. It’s essential that you write automated tests.

- **Testing is done far too late in the delivery process**—There certainly is a role for tests that critique an application after it’s been written, but experience has shown that those tests are insufficient. A much better approach is for developers to write automated tests as part of development. It improves their productivity because, for example, they’ll have tests that provide immediate feedback while editing code.

## 1.1. Overview of testing

Wikipedia defines a test case, or test, as follows:

A test case is a set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected results developed for a particular objective, such as to exercise a particular program path or to verify compliance with a specific requirement.
